## Instructions

 A physical store which sells 3 products:

```
Code         | Name                |  Price
-------------------------------------------------
VOUCHER      | Cabify Voucher      |   5.00€
TSHIRT       | Cabify T-Shirt      |  20.00€
MUG          | Cafify Coffee Mug   |   7.50€
```

Various departments have insisted on the following discounts:
- The marketing department believes in 2-for-1 promotions (buy two of the same product, get one free), and would like for there to be a 2-for-1 special on VOUCHER items.
- The CFO insists that the best way to increase sales is with discounts on bulk purchases (buying x or more of a product, the price of that product is reduced), and demands that if you buy 3 or more TSHIRT items, the price per unit should be 19.00€.
